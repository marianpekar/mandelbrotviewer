# Mandelbrot Viewer

An application that generates Mandelbrot set and renders with **SDL library**.  It has point&click zoom and unzoom feature and is **configurable via JSON file config.json**.

### Thanks to...
* John Purcell for amazing C++ courses (http://www.caveofprogramming.com). I've used in this project a lot I learned from them.
* Niels Lohmann for an awesome JSON header-only library (https://github.com/nlohmann/json). I love this library.
* And all who contributed over years to SDL library (https://www.libsdl.org).
